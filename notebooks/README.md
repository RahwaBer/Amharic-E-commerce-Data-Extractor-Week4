## üìÑ Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

* **Channel Selection**: Reviewed `channels_to_crawl.csv` and identified 5 target Telegram channels for data extraction.
* **Real-Time Scraper Setup**: Implemented a real-time data ingestion system using the `Telethon` library to collect:

  * Amharic messages
  * Media files (images/documents)
  * Metadata (timestamps, channel info)
* **Data Storage**: Structured messages and media paths saved.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Preprocessing

* **Text Cleaning**:

  * Normalized Amharic characters
  * Removed emojis, Latin text, and special symbols
  * Standardized whitespace
* **Tokenization**:

  * Custom whitespace-based tokenization for Ge'ez script
  * Saved as `structured_telegram_data.csv` with fields: `channel`, `date`, `media_path`, `cleaned_text`, `tokens`

---

### ‚úÖ Task 2: CoNLL Formatting for NER

* Generated a baseline CoNLL template file (`labeled_data_template.txt`) where each token is labeled as `O` (outside any entity).
* Defined entity types according to the business objective:

  * `B-Product`, `I-Product`
  * `B-PRICE`, `I-PRICE`
  * `B-LOC`, `I-LOC`
* Built an interactive Python labeling tool using Jupyter widgets to assist with efficient manual annotation.
* Output saved to `labeled_data_final.conll.txt` for fine-tuning NER models.

## ‚úÖ Task 3 Summary ‚Äì Fine-Tuning NER Model for Amharic

In this task, I fine-tuned a transformer-based model to recognize named entities (Product, Price, Location) in Amharic e-commerce messages collected from Telegram.

### üîß Steps Completed:

1. **Model Selection**:
   I selected `rasyosef/bert-tiny-amharic`, a compact and efficient pre-trained model designed specifically for Amharic text.

2. **Dataset Preparation**:

   * Parsed the manually labeled dataset in **CoNLL format** (`labeled_data_final.conll.txt`)
   * Converted it into Hugging Face‚Äôs `DatasetDict` format with `train` and `validation` splits.
   * Mapped entity labels to numerical IDs (`B-Product`, `I-PRICE`, `B-LOC`, etc.).

3. **Tokenization & Label Alignment**:

   * Used the model's tokenizer to tokenize each sentence.
   * Aligned word-level entity labels with subword tokens (handling cases where words are split).

4. **Training Setup**:

   * Defined training arguments (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, evaluation strategy).
   * Implemented evaluation metrics using `seqeval` for F1-score, precision, and recall.

5. **Model Fine-Tuning**:

   * Used Hugging Face‚Äôs `Trainer` API to train the model on the labeled dataset.
   * Performed validation at each epoch and saved the best-performing model automatically.

6. **Model Saving**:

   * Saved the fine-tuned model and tokenizer in `amharic_ner_bert_tiny_model` directory for reuse.

### üéØ Outcome:

I have now a working Amharic NER model capable of identifying **product names, prices, and locations** in Telegram messages.

## ‚úÖ Task 4 Summary ‚Äì Model Comparison & Selection

### üéØ Goal:

Compare the performance of different pre-trained models fine-tuned on the same Amharic NER dataset using consistent training configurations.

### ‚úÖ Models Evaluated:

| Model                                | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `rasyosef/bert-tiny-amharic`         | Compact Amharic-specific model (low resource) |
| `xlm-roberta-base`                   | Large multilingual model with strong accuracy |
| `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased` | Lightweight multilingual BERT variant         |
| `bert-base-multilingual-cased`       | Standard multilingual BERT                    |

---

### üß™ Process:

1. **Tokenizer & Model Loading**:
   Each model was loaded with corresponding tokenizers, adapted for NER by adding a classification head for the custom entity labels (`B-Product`, `I-PRICE`, etc.).

2. **Label Alignment**:
   Entity labels were aligned with subword tokens produced by each tokenizer using a custom mapping function.

3. **Training Configuration**:
   Consistent training settings were applied across all models, including:

   * Learning rate: `2e-5`
   * Epochs: `5`
   * Evaluation strategy: `epoch`
   * Metric: F1-score via `seqeval`

4. **Fine-Tuning**:
   Each model was fine-tuned using Hugging Face's `Trainer` API on the same dataset (with train/validation split).

5. **Evaluation & Saving**:
   Performance metrics (F1-score, precision, recall) were recorded, and the best model for each was saved for future use.

### üèÜ Selected Model:

Based on performance and resource efficiency, the **`xlm-roberta-base`** model is recommended for deployment due to its high F1-score and robustness across Amharic text.
